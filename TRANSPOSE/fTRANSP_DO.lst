    4.    ! PURPOSE:
    5.    !  This routine takes as input a distributed matrix 
    6.    !  g and copies it into a "transposed" matrix gT 
    7.    !  also distributed across processors:
    8.    !
    9.    !             g({ij},k) -> gT({jk},i)
   10.    !
   11.    !  The curly braces denote a subset of indices. 
   12.    !  The distributed index can be combination of 
   13.    !  many indices stacked together, as indicated by 
   14.    !  the notation.
   15.    !
   16.    ! NOTES:
   17.    !  Communication routine originally used in old GYRO.
