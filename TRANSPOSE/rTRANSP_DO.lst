    4.    ! PURPOSE:
    5.    !  This routine takes as input a distributed matrix g and 
    6.    !  copies it into a "transposed" matrix gT also distributed 
    7.    !  across processors:
    8.    !
    9.    !             g({ij},k) -> gT({ki},j)
   10.    !
   11.    !  The curly braces denote a subset of indices.  The 
   12.    !  distributed index can be combination of many indices 
   13.    !  stacked together, as indicated by the notation.
   14.    !
   15.    ! NOTES:
   16.    !  Communication routine originally used in old GYRO.
