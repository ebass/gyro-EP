    4.    ! PURPOSE:
    5.    !  Compute nonlinear transfer (n,p) spectrum 
    6.    !  Compute turbulent entropy (n,p) spectrum S_k
    7.    !  for both periodic boundary conditions
    8.    !  
    9.    !  d(S_k+W_k)/dt = Tr_k + 2.*gammaS_k*S_k
   10.    !
   11.    !  k = (kx,ky)
   12.    !
   13.    !  Sum_k Tr_k = 0
   14.    !
   15.    !  Sum_k 2.*gamma_k*S_k = F + D's
   16.    !
   17.    !  d(S+W)/dt = F+D's   
   18.    ! see Eq (41) amd Eqs(42)-(47) Candy & Waltz PoP 13 (2006) 032310
   19.    ! 
   20.    !  on time average  d(S_k+W_k)/dt = 0  and d(S+W)/dt = 0
   21.    !
   22.    !  so -Tr_k/2./S_k = gammaS_k = (F_k+D's_k)/2./S_k can be regarded as 
   23.    !   1/2 the rate of entropy generagtion
   24.    !  at the (n,p) = (ky,kx) mode
   25.    !
   26.    !  "two * gammaS_k"  because S_k is a bilinear object and we want to compare
   27.    !  gammaS_k to gamma_k (amplitude growth rate)  
   28.    !
   29.    !  At steady state -Sum_k Tr_k =  F + D's = 0, i.e. F > 0 = -D's
   30.    !
   31.    !  tpyically S >> W the small polarization part and we need not worky about it
   32.    !  S is the "bare" entropy of the entropy in the gyrocenters
   33.    !  actually we will track only the ion entropy
   34.    !
   35.    !  Essentially Tr_k = (g_k_star*NL_k + g_k*NL_k_star)/4 = (h_k_star*NL_k + h_k*NL_k_star)/4
   36.    !  with a flux surface average included
   37.    !
   38.    !   S_k ----> Eng_k   is GYRO lable used.
