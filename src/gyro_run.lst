    4.    ! PURPOSE:
    5.    !  This is the actual system call to run GYRO via subroutine 
    6.    !  interface (i.e, from TGYRO).
    7.    !
    8.    ! NOTES:
    9.    ! - To run GYRO as a subroutine, do this:
   10.    !   call gyro_init
   11.    !   call gyro_run
   12.    !  
   13.    ! - To run inside TGYRO, we do this:
   14.    !   call tgyro_gyro_map (calls gyro_init)
   15.    !   call gyro_run(...)
