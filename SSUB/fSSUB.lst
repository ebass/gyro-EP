    4.    ! PURPOSE:
    5.    !  Within a processor subgroup (defined in 
    6.    !  SSUB_init), with one value of n per 
    7.    !  processor in the subgroup, collect all
    8.    !  n's on one processor and distribute the 
    9.    !  j's.  Since n_j is typically larger than
   10.    !  n_n, we need jsplit rows is j's.
   11.    !            
   12.    !       x(:,:,n_j) -> xT(:,:,jsplit,n_n)
   13.    !
   14.    ! NOTES:
   15.    !  This scheme is most efficient when n_j 
   16.    !  is a multiple of n_n.
