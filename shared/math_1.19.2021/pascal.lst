    5.    !  Compute coefficients in Pascal's triangle, with added 
    6.    !  alternating sign.
    7.    !
    8.    ! NOTES:
    9.    !  Equivalently, these are the coefficients of the 
   10.    !  centered n-th derivative operator.  Below, we have 
   11.    !  supressed the alternating sign.
