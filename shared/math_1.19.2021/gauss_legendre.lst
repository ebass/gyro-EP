    4.    ! PURPOSE:
    5.    !  Given the lower and upper limits of integration, x1 and 
    6.    !  x2, and given n, this routine returns arrays x and w of 
    7.    !  length n, containing the abscissas and weights of the 
    8.    !  Gauss-Legendre n-point quadrature formula.
    9.    !
   10.    ! NOTES:
   11.    !  Taken from "Numerical Recipes" routine GAULEG.
   12.    !
   13.    !  Book uses eps = 3e-14 -- this has been decreased.
   14.    !
   15.    ! REVISIONS
   16.    ! 06 Dec 00: jeff.candy@gat.com
   17.    !  Copied from book.  
   18.    !  Recoded in f90 (with *explicit* variable declarations).
   19.    !  Added exception for n=1.
